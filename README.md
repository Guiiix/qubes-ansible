# Ansible Connection and Module for QubesOS

This project provides an Ansible connection plugin to interact with [Qubes OS](https://qubes-os.org) virtual machines called `qubes` and an Ansible module to manage the state of your qubes.
The `qubesos` module is under active development, so the syntax and keywords may change in future releases.
